I used to be a professional chef and have worked in numerous Michelin starred restaurants including;

- The Ledbury, Notting Hill, London ⭐️⭐️
- Dabbous Restaurant, Fitzrovia, London ⭐️

So, as an aspiring data scientist this dataset interests me. 

I would like to attempt to map restaurant density on a map. (Maybe this will be too hard)

For now, it will be good practice of regex techniques
